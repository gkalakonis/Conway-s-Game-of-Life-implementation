# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-implementation
This is a simple implementation of Conway's "Game of life" and one of its variation called "Live Free or Die". The application offers the ability  for the user to choose which cells will be alive or it can create a random combination. Specifically for "Conway's Gmae of life" it offers certain predetermined types of lifeforms(patterns) that present specific properties (for example "blocks" stay stable and do not change over generations, "gliders" travel the board through generations repeating their shape after a number of steps), the occurrence percentage for each of those lifeforms is also calculated and displayed. Finally,the user can continue to the next generation or skip n number of generations.
