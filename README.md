# Conway-s-Game-of-Life-implementation
This is a simple implementation of Conway's "Game of life" and one of its variation called "Live Free or Die". The application offers the ability  for the user to choose which cells will be alive or it can create a random combination. Specifically for "Conway's Game of life" it offers certain predetermined types of lifeforms(patterns) that present special properties (for example "blocks" stay stable and do not change over generations, "gliders" travel the board through generations repeating their shape after a number of steps), the occurrence percentage for each of those lifeforms is also calculated and displayed. Finally,the user can continue to the next generation or skip n number of generations.

## Modes
### Game of Life
#### Rules
-Every cell with two or three alive neighboring  cells survives to the next generation

-Every cell with four or more alive neighboring  cells dies due to overpopulation

-Every cell with one or none alive neighboring  cells due to loneliness

-Every cell with exaclty three  alive neighboring  cells comes to life

-Every cell with exaclty two  alive neighboring  cells comes to life
